# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** 2026-02-25

This Privacy Policy describes how **Splat-Frame** (“the app”) handles information.

## Summary
- The app **does not collect, store, or share** personal data.
- The app processes content **only on your device**.
- The app does not sell data and does not use data for advertising.

## Information We Collect
**None.**  
We do not collect personal information, usage analytics, identifiers, or location data.

## On-Device Processing
Any content you provide to the app (for example, images, video, text, or other files) is processed locally on your device. That content is not transmitted to us.

## Face Data and TrueDepth Camera Information

Splat Frame uses the iPhone’s TrueDepth camera to track your head position in real time. The app collects only the minimum data required for this feature: your head’s position (x, y, z coordinates) and orientation, as provided by Apple’s ARKit Face Tracking API. No facial features, biometric identifiers, or raw camera images are stored or processed.

### Purpose of Collection:
This information is used solely to create a 3D “window” effect for splat videos and interactive cube scenes, adjusting the perspective based on your head movement. The data is processed on-device in real time and is never used for identification, authentication, or any other purpose.

### Data Sharing and Storage:
Face tracking data is not shared with third parties and is not stored, transmitted, or retained beyond the duration of your session. All processing occurs locally on your device.

### Disclosure and Retention:
Splat Frame does not retain, export, or disclose any face data. No face data leaves your device, and no face data is accessible to the developer or any external party

## Data Sharing
We do not share your data with third parties because we do not collect it.

## Data Retention
We do not retain your data on our servers. Any data the app creates (such as settings or output files) remains on your device unless you delete it.

## Third-Party Services
The app does not use third-party analytics or advertising SDKs.  
If you access third-party links or services from within the app (if any), those services are governed by their own privacy policies.

## Children’s Privacy
The app does not knowingly collect personal information from children, and it does not collect personal information from anyone.

## Changes to This Policy
If the app’s behavior changes in a way that affects privacy, we will update this Privacy Policy and change the “Last updated” date above.
